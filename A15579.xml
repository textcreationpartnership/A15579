            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20802:6"/>and matchleſſe fidelity, was made apparant, and did ſhew it ſelf, in all the ſervice he did him, it being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed (during ſo many yeares) with extraordinary honeſty, and endeavour. On the other, there is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the monſtrous vnkindnes, groſſe jnjuſtice, and many other the vnſavory fruits of a <hi>currish nature,</hi> and <hi>covetous hart,</hi> in <hi>Laban,</hi> whoſe eye was ever <hi>evill,</hi> vpon all <hi>Iacobs good,</hi> inſomuch that he did daily vexe himſelf, with perpetuall repining at his wealth, welfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, and, proſperity.</p>
            <p>The juſt <hi>Lord</hi> ſeeing this in <hi>Laban,</hi> looketh downe from heaven, with gracious regard vpon <hi>Iacob,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth to recompence his righteouſnes vnto him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had <hi>done</hi> ſoe much, and <hi>endured</hi> ſo much, from ſuch a churliſh kinſman, and vnworthy maſter as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> had ſhewed himſelf to be.

               </hi> be cloſe-ſiſted: <hi>Iacob</hi> shall wel know, that he hath <hi>a maſter in heaven,</hi> who will make him a full mend's for all his integrity to his <hi>master on earth.</hi> And to the end he may as <hi>fully</hi> enjoy it, as <hi>God</hi> is mynded <hi>freely</hi> to beſtow it, he is warned of <hi>God</hi> to goe for his contrey, and leaue <hi>Laban,</hi> with whome he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver comfortably poſeſſe the ſweetnes of <hi>any</hi> of thoſe <hi>many</hi> good things, the <hi>Lord</hi> did ſoe kindely caſt vpon him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacob</hi> taking knowledge of his heavenly calling, and commiſſion to be gone, doth inſtanly reſolue on his departure diſpatcheth his buſines, ſetteth things in order, &amp; diſpoſeth himſelf, &amp; all his, to remoue with all poſſible expedition, according to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God warranting him <hi>(forh with)</hi> ſoe to doe.</p>
            <p>Being thus, ſoe ſuddanily gone, as <hi>Laban</hi> tooke noe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20802:6"/>notice of it till one tolde him of it, three dayes after: <hi>[ſuch being the diligence, and conſcience of a good ſervant, that the hart of his maſter may haue confidence in him, and not neede to care for, or looke after him, or his buſines, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers dayes together]</hi> aſſoone as he did know it, he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and poaſteth after him, with all ſpeede, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him, if he can, and at <hi>mount Gilead</hi> he doth. And there (his hart being <hi>big ſwollen,</hi> and ready too <hi>burſt</hi> with choller and diſcontentment) he meane's to haue a ſaying to him; <hi>Iacob</hi> shall know a peice of his minde ere they part, if once hee can come to the ſpeech of him.</p>
            <p>But before <hi>Laban may</hi> ſpeake with Iacob, God <hi>muſt</hi> ſpeake with <hi>Laban</hi> &amp; (jntending to overule his wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full minde, and outragious mouth) the <hi>Lord</hi> doth ſo ſchoole him, that hee cannot giue him an vnkinde word, but is become as <hi>coole,</hi> and as <hi>calme,</hi> as a man may be, he <hi>ſpeake's</hi> moſt familiarly to him, <hi>make's</hi> a moſt freindly league with him, &amp; <hi>take's</hi> his leaue moſt lovingly of him, and ſoe they part exceeding pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably one from the other.</p>
            <p>This being <hi>done,</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> being <hi>gone, Iacob</hi> jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth homeward, and becauſe the <hi>Lord</hi> did forſee, he should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>That whoſoever would goe to God with any comfort by prayer,

            <p>The evidence of this truth is very abundant in the booke of God, but we will abridge our ſelues, and be content with a few confirmations, it were needeles to multiply many in a point ſoe playne.</p>

And haue ye ever heard of any petitioner that ſped bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or that prevayled more, then he did? nay, may we not think that he was a great gayner by this courſe, when (herevpon) he exhorteth others out of his owne abundant &amp; happy experience in this particuler, to <hi>powre out &amp; emity their harts,</hi> &amp; wholy to <hi>vnlade</hi> &amp; lay them ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before the Lord, which no man (you know) will doe, but to <hi>him,</hi> in <hi>whome</hi> he hath more then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary intereſt, and <hi>with whome</hi> he is exceeding inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate &amp; familiar.

            <p>Sixtly, &amp; laſtly, the truth we teach may moſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare by our conſideration of <hi>their estate,</hi> who haue no <hi>interest</hi> in the Lord, and are <hi>none of his;</hi> what are ſuch in the Lords account and conſtruction, and whether doe they pray or noe? and if they doe, with what good affection, or aſſurance of gracious anſwer?

And I doe appeale to the ſoule of any vngodly perſon, with what affection, or conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had prayed, with what favour and compaſſion he hath beene anſwered.

            <p>And it is well to be noted,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> that the apoſtle tell's vs that the ſame ſpirit that aſſure's vs we are the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, doth not only embolden vs (as was remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred before) to cry <hi>[Abba father]</hi> but in caſe it ſtand ſoe wit vs,

<note place="margin">Pſa. 77.3.4.</note> &amp; may be the condition, of any true, &amp; tender harted chriſtian,) I ſay, this ſpirit doth pray, and preferre, our requeſts for vs, our very <hi>aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> it ſelf, will ſpeake for vs, through we could not ſpeake for our ſelues. Even <hi>this,</hi> that we are <hi>Gods,</hi> is (if we could vtter no more,) enough to harten vs, in the hope of being heard, as we finde by him, who ſayd this and no more,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 146.6.7.</note> [<hi>I ſayd vnto the Lord thou art</hi> my God; <hi>heare my prayer o Lord</hi>] and further, [<hi>O Lord God of</hi> my <hi>ſaluation</hi>] &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nay not only in prayer, but in the whole worship of God are we cheered, by this ſame reaſon; ſoe ſaith the ſpirit of God.
<note place="margin">Pſa. 95.6.</note> [<hi>Come let vs worship &amp;c, for he is the Lord</hi> our God, <hi>we are the people of</hi> his <hi>pasture and the sheept of</hi> his <hi>hands],</hi> ſo that, if vpon any tearmes, a man will

            <p>Thus our conſolation come's vpon vs in regard of our <hi>prayers,</hi> when we can goe to God as to our <hi>owne,</hi> it matters not, how <hi>Satan</hi> may otherwiſe entwitte vs, as long he cannot overturne our <hi>title.</hi>

            <p>And the joy, and comfort of this conſideration, will yet shyne more clearely vpon vs, if we marke well how <hi>wicked men,</hi> when they come to ſpeake to God doe not once offer to vtter <hi>one word of interest,</hi> but ſtill come, with <hi>generall appellation,</hi> without any ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, or <hi>particuler impropriation</hi> of God to <hi>themſelfs,</hi>

            <p>Oh, that their ſoules could conſider this, who thus forget both God, and themſelues,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 50.22.</note> and now <hi>(before men)</hi> fawne vpon him with prophane <hi>tongues</hi> and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall <hi>harts,</hi> ſpeaking of him as of <hi>their ſweete Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and <hi>their deare ſauior,</hi> whenas, <hi>(before his owne face)</hi> they dare not at all entitle him ſoe: who ſeeth not but that their former prayers were <hi>vile,</hi> (being hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically preſumptuous,) and theſe latter <hi>vayne,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20802:17"/>themſelues reprobated of God, for <hi>pretending</hi> a title before men, and <hi>wanting</hi> it, when they appeare before himſelf. But of this, we shall haue better occaſion, to ſpeake more in our next vſe.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, this want of <hi>interest</hi> in them, is that which debarre's them of all preſent <hi>comfort,</hi> and brings them vnder Gods eternall <hi>curſe,</hi> all their ſupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations be caſt away <hi>first,</hi> and themſelues alſo, <hi>at laſt,</hi> becauſe they haue <hi>it</hi> not.

            </p>
            <p>And this is the firſt comfort that flow'es from our intereſt,

            </p>
            <p>Nay, Gods reaſoning is quite contrary, for wheras

            <p>Let vs take ſome taſte of both, that we may ſee <hi>how good the Lord is</hi> to his <hi>owne,</hi> though they be <hi>euill</hi> before him; yet ever with this <hi>caution;</hi> that what we shall ſpeake, doe harten no man to commit the leaſt ſin, but to encounter Satan when he would haue vs adde <hi>infidelity,</hi> to our <hi>jmpiety;</hi> and make our ſtate <hi>deſperate now,</hi> which was but <hi>distreſſed before.</hi> Nothing is more ſure then this, that God never gaue any man any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of this good who doth <hi>therby abett</hi> himſelf in <hi>any euill:</hi>

            <p>Suppoſe ſome <hi>baſe varlet,</hi> the knowne <hi>bastard</hi> of ſome notorious <hi>ſtrumpet,</hi> should thus fawne vpon a man of approved <hi>honesty</hi> and <hi>honour (admit, he were a Prince)</hi> and whereſoever he came, be ſtill calling him <hi>his father,</hi> and laying challeng, and <hi>clayme</hi> vnto him, were it not an <hi>infamy</hi> and an <hi>iniury</hi> not to be borne?

            <p>Let vs looke what (in one place of a multitude we might alledge) the Lord ſaith to this purpoſe, by the prophet <hi>Ieremiah.
<note place="margin">Jer 32.38 ver. 39. ver. 40.</note> [And I wilbe their God, and they shalbe my people; And I will giue them one hart and one way that they may feare me for euer, &amp;c: And I will ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke an euer lasting couenant with them that I will not turne a way from them to doe them good, but I will put my feare into their harts, and they shall neuer depart from me &amp;c.</hi> Beholde here is the ſumme and <hi>abridgment,</hi> of Gods gracious covenant, with a mutuall <hi>(and moſt merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)</hi> offer of himſelf to be <hi>theirs,</hi> and acceptation of them to be <hi>his;</hi> but vpon what tearmes? even vpon thoſe aforeſayd, to wit, that they be poſeſt with the feare of his majeſty (and, <hi>the feare of the Lord is to hate euill,
<note place="margin">Pro.</note> and to depart from it,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith) and walke before him <hi>ſoe,</hi> as that they never turne back from him, but goe on, <hi>constantly,</hi> and <hi>conſcionably</hi> in a holy courſe of heavenly converſation before his majeſty, in which <hi>reformed</hi> carriage of theirs he hath moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly promiſed, not only that <hi>he</hi> will not depart from <hi>them,</hi> but that <hi>they shall</hi> not depart from <hi>him;</hi> note: <hi>[they shall neuer depart from me]</hi> that is, they shalbe ſoe preſerved by the <hi>power,</hi> and through the <hi>favour,</hi> of God, that though <hi>Satan,</hi> and their <hi>ſin,</hi> doe their <hi>worst,</hi> yet they shall not leave the Lord, or fall from him; noe though <hi>(through the extreame violence, of ſome extraordinary, and execrable temptation)</hi> they should <hi>deſire, endeavour,</hi> or <hi>ſtriue</hi> to goe from God, yet (ſaith God) they <hi>shall not,</hi> doe they, or their ſin, or the divell what they <hi>can.</hi> And this is a moſt confortable <hi>cordaill</hi> againſt thoſe faint <hi>hart quaumes,</hi> which oftimes doe fill the harts of the ſaints with miſerables feares: they
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20802:34"/>are afrayd they shall fall from God, and are in great doubt they shall proue <hi>hypocrites,</hi> and <hi>apostates,</hi> when all is done, and the divell takes pleaſure to <hi>affright</hi> them thus with ſuch fearfull &amp; perplexing thoughts: why but doe if you <hi>can,</hi> the Lord ſayes you <hi>shall</hi> not depart from him; you are like a foolish childe in the armes of his father, carrying him over a <hi>riuer,</hi> who looke's downe and ſeing the <hi>water,</hi> crye's out, Oh <hi>I shall fall, I shall fall,</hi> whenas his father holde's him ſo faſt, that he shall not fall though he should ſtrive therevnto, there being <hi>more strength</hi> in the father to ſupport, and <hi>care</hi> to keepe the childe, then there is <hi>ability</hi> in the childe to doe himſelf this evill.

Looke you to your <hi>reformation,</hi> let the Lord alone with your <hi>protection,</hi> if you be <hi>his,</hi> you neede not feare falling from <hi>him,</hi> and if he have given you conſcience to amend your evill wayes ands works, and to make them <hi>good,</hi> his <hi>goodnes</hi> shall dwell with you, and you are within the compaſſe of that <hi>kinde intereſt</hi> which is peculiar to all his ſaints. I shall not neede to call other <hi>prophets</hi> to give atteſtation to this truth, it is the generall voyce of them all, that as <hi>Iſraell</hi> had fallen from God by their <hi>rebellion,</hi> ſoe they should now be fully joyned to him by <hi>reformation.</hi> And all reaſon aſſents her vnto, inaſmuch as we know till <hi>Adam</hi> (and we in him) was <hi>deformed,</hi> he was Gods, and being ſoe his <hi>title</hi> ceaſed, and he became <hi>Satans:</hi> our <hi>reformed state</hi> then, muſt be
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20802:35"/>the evidence of our <hi>restored estate</hi> to God againe, as our <hi>corrupted</hi> eſtate was, of our alienation from him.</p>
            <p>Looke we after this, and labour for it; ſeing it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth that we are <hi>faſt</hi> to God if we be <hi>reformed;</hi> and let them tremble to entitle themſelues to the Lord, whoſe evill doth yet <hi>cleaue</hi> vnto them, and continue in them, without that due <hi>reformation</hi> which the Lord doth require, and for which, he doth <hi>condition</hi> with ſoe many as he accepteth. <hi>Noe vnreformed perſon hath any right in God.</hi> If any of them <hi>dreame</hi> they have, let them know the Lord doth directy <hi>diſclaime</hi> them, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure they should come ſoe neere him, as to medle with <hi>any thing of his,</hi> (to wit, as with <hi>their owne,</hi>) till they shew forth the fruits of a reformed life. So we read <hi>[what haſt thou to doe to take my couenant in thy mouth,

            <p>The argument is more vndoubted, and demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, betweene <hi>God</hi> and <hi>his</hi> children, then betweene <hi>men</hi> and <hi>theirs,</hi> for in nature it is not <hi>vniuerſally</hi> and <hi>infaillibly</hi> true, that <hi>conſimilitude</hi> doth argue <hi>conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity,</hi> ſtrangers may be exceeding like one another.

               <hi>Adam,</hi> (I meane the <hi>first Adam</hi>) was the ſon of

            <p>Chriſt Ieſus (the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi>) was the ſon of God by an eternall, and inconceivable kinde of <hi>generation,</hi> and how did his <hi>ſonship</hi> (when in times fullnes he was incarnate) shew it ſelf? wherby was he knowne to be the true naturall ſon of the moſt high? why even by this, that he was <hi>ſo like</hi> his father, that, as himſelf ſaith, <hi>[he that hath ſeene me hath ſeene my father]</hi> and as the Apoſtle ſaith,
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.9.

            <p>And as it was with theſe two, wherof the one was his ſon by <hi>creation,</hi> the other by <hi>generation,</hi> ſoe muſt, and will it be <hi>(in their meaſure)</hi> with all his ſons and daughters by grace and <hi>regeneration.</hi> They muſt alſo be like vnto him, who (in his loue) hath begotten

<note place="margin">Ro 6.4.5.</note> there is a cleare conformity to Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
            <p>And this jmage or ſimilitude vnto our ſaviour is abundantly preſſed vpon vs, and made knowne to be the minde of God, and a manifeſt evidence of our <hi>interst</hi> in many particulers. Nothing is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called for at our hands, then that we should be <hi>holy as he is holy, mercifull as be is mercifull, perfect as he is perfect, followers</hi> or <hi>imitators</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>lyke myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> to him, &amp; <hi>learning</hi> of him all patience, kindnes, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility meekenes, and every ſaving grace, whereby it may appeare that <hi>[we are made partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture]</hi> in the <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municable</hi> qualities therof,

            <p>That ſoe, as we have borne the image of the earthly <hi>Adam</hi> in ſin and corruption, (and thereby made it too evident, that we are his children and heires of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation) ſoe alſo we should beare the image of the

And that <hi>this image of his</hi> (to wit, our <hi>conformity</hi> to Chriſt) is an evidence infallible &amp; vndoubted herof, is moſt cleare by that which the <hi>Apostle</hi> directly layeth downe and avoucheth when he telleth vs, that [<hi>thoſe whome the Lord did fore-know</hi> (to be his elect) <hi>them,
<note place="margin">Ro. 8.26.</note> he did predeſtinate to be like the image of his ſonne</hi>] ſoe that we ſee how the depth of this profound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>praedestination</hi> may be <hi>ſounded,</hi> and <hi>ſoundly</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned (as touching the evidence of the ſame) by every man in himſelf, and one may ceartainly know himſelf to be <hi>predestinated</hi> of God to live for ever with him in life and glory, if he be caſt into a <hi>new moulde</hi> &amp; made a <hi>new lumpe</hi> like to Ieſus Chriſt.

For if a man doe carry the image of the <hi>Lord Ieſus</hi> in grace and holines, he is <hi>(without controverſy)</hi> appointed to be glorifyed with him, but while he continueth in a <hi>curſed conformity</hi> to ſin and corruption, and beares the likenes of the <hi>old Adam,</hi> or rather of the olde ſerpent, he may know he belong's not to Gods decree of election, becauſe all ſuch as appertaine therevnto, are as well predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be <hi>gracious on earth,</hi> as to be <hi>glorious in heaven.</hi> Theſe <hi>two</hi> were never parted yet, in any perſon whatſoever: Gods predeſtination of <hi>grace</hi> is as

            </p>
            <p>Now then, let every man ſearch himſelf, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to apprehend aright how it is with him herin, that he may well vnderſtand, whether he hath <hi>belyed the Lord</hi> or noe, when he hath called him <hi>his.</hi> For he that doth ſoe, and is not like him, hath <hi>lyed</hi> vnto God fo oft, as he hath layd clayme to him.

            <p>The ſpirit of God never work's <hi>deſire of having good from God,</hi> without <hi>deſire of doing good before God.</hi> It teacheth men how to <hi>practiſe,</hi> as well as how to <hi>pray:</hi> and make's men as willing to <hi>obey</hi> Gods <hi>precepts,</hi> as they are, that the Lord should <hi>anſwer</hi> ther <hi>prayers.</hi> And when once a man ha's gotten a hart thus reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, vpon <hi>vniuerſall</hi> and <hi>conſtant</hi> obedience to the Lord, and that he had <hi>(of the two)</hi> rather doe the <hi>will of God,</hi> then have his <hi>owne will</hi> accomplished, he may aſſuredly know, he hath <hi>right</hi> in the Lord.

And nothing but the ſpirit of God can give this power to any man. He that hath it then, hath the ſpirit &amp; he who hath the ſpirit of God, the ſame is <hi>Gods,</hi> as we heard before.

               <hi>offers,</hi> ſuffer ſuch <hi>oppreſsions</hi> as he doth, for his ſake. By the ſame reaſon is our <hi>nearenes</hi> vnto God conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

            <p>Having done with his <hi>first</hi> encouragme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to the conſideration of his <hi>ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> as it lieth in the text following <hi>[Thou Lord which ſaidest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; Returne into thy countrey</hi> &amp;c.] wher in he <hi>(now)</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his <hi>warrant</hi> he had <hi>from</hi> God, as (before) he did his <hi>interest</hi> he had <hi>in</hi> God.

            <p>The former to wit, his warrant he divides into two particulers:
<list>

            <p>If this were not an abſolute, and an vndenyable truth, why did the <hi>Lord giue Jacob</hi> this comiſſion for his journey, or why should <hi>Jacob take it,</hi> and make this vſe of it to God himſelf, as he doth: it were no <hi>favour</hi> or <hi>mercy</hi> to haue it, no point of <hi>faith,</hi> no <hi>part of</hi> our <hi>duty</hi> to vſe, or to vrge it, if we might be juſtifyed in any thing we vndertake without it.

            <p>The thing we ayme at, is not ſoe much the <hi>matter of</hi> the <hi>warrant</hi> it ſelf, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> taking of it home &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of it to himſelf, in that he ſaith <hi>[Thou Lord who ſaydeſt vnto me]</hi> From which practiſe of his, <hi>we may</hi> obſerue, and <hi>you must</hi> learne thus much. <hi>That it is the duty of every chirstian to carry the word of God home to his owne hart, and to apply it particulerly to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="84" facs="tcp:20802:47"/>
            <p>Looke what ſacred truth the Lord hath left <hi>recorded for vs, and</hi> either in any <hi>generall ſpeciall,</hi> or <hi>particuler</hi> rule of his word <hi>revealed to vs,</hi> as tending to our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuler eſtate, the ſame ſoe farre as it <hi>toucheth</hi> vs in any thing that doth, or may concerne vs, the Lord looke's we should lay it to our harts, and appropriate it to our ſelves as <hi>our owne.</hi> Every true chriſtian is bounde to apply every part of Gods truth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf evermore making that his owne, which is mean't to him.</p>
            <p>The inſtance of our text, contayneth ſo cleare an evidence and confirmation of this doctrine, and this holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> practiſe is <hi>ſo pregnant</hi> for the point that we shall not neede to ſeeke farre for more witnes, to enforce the truth of it. Let vs a litle conſider his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage herin.</p>
            <p>We heard <hi>before,</hi> how God had ſpoken vnto him, about this buſines of his removall into his countrey, here <hi>now,</hi> we have himſelf not only <hi>relating</hi> what God ſaid to him herin, but alſo <hi>applying</hi> the ſame to his owne hart, and ſtate: now that he is to goe to heaven for direction and comfort in the ſame, in <hi>ſpeaking</hi> to God, he <hi>ſpeakes</hi> that which God ſpake to him <hi>[thou Lord who ſayd vnto me &amp;c.]</hi> he cleave's faſt vnto that which he heard from God, and let's God heare of it from him againe, he claymes Gods kindnes, builde's vpon his precept and promiſe as vpon a foundation of direction, conſolation and aſſurance, ſufficiently able to beare him out againſt all oppoſition what-ſoever. The precept leade's him to begin his journey, the promiſe hartens him to goe on, <hi>hoth</hi> are good to him in the duty he had to doe. And (we ſee) that as Iacob is faithfull in applying all this, ſo is the Lord <hi>carefull</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:20802:47"/>in reporting this his practiſe vnto vs, and make's <hi>Moſes</hi> (many yeares after it was performed) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from his ſpirit by inſpiration, and to regiſter it in this his <hi>bleſſed booke,</hi> that it may remayne written for all ages to come for <hi>his approbation,</hi> for <hi>our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> that we might follow him who hath gone befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re vs herin, and not only know, what <hi>Iacob</hi> hath done but what the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> require's of vs from this light of his truth, both to know &amp; to doe, in any ſuch caſes as may ever become <hi>ours,</hi> in any paſſage betwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the Lord and vs.</p>
            <p>In a word, what he here did, is therefore written and related, that we might goe and doe likewiſe, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the ſame path which this true ſurvant of God hath troden out before vs, which if we shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour conſcionably to doe, and to be vpright with the Lord in the ſame, what our benefit and advantage shalbe, the ſequell will shew, and we shall ever finde it our happines to lay Gods truth to hart. Thus we ſee the caſe is cleare in the particuler of our text.</p>
            <p>If we shall looke further abroade, for our more aſſurance in the truth of this inſtruction, and take vp ſuch teſtimonyes as we might ſoone finde, &amp; faſten vpon to this preſent purpoſe, multitudes would flow apace vpon vs, and it would be much more eaſy to <hi>ouer-abounde,</hi> then want any, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. But we will not cloy your memories with a multiplicity.</p>
            <p>Shall we enquire at the <hi>Law,</hi> according to the holy <hi>Prophets</hi> counſell? why, it is cleare for this point. It is a <hi>ruled caſe</hi> with, the great law-giver, even the, Lord who is <hi>[that one law-giuer, which is
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20802:48"/>able to ſaue and deſtroy]</hi> hath given it once, and againe, and many times in expreſſe charge to his people. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ſeriouſly what he ſaith by Moſes <hi>[And theſe words which I commandeth thee shalbe in thy hart] And thou shalt teach them to thy children &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Dent. 6.6. ver. 7.8.</note> And thou shalt binde them for a ſigne vpon thy hand, and they shalbe as frontlets betweene thine eyes.]</hi> Now what meanes all this? what may all theſe <hi>injunctions</hi> intend which are ſet downe <hi>here,</hi> and itterated <hi>elſwhere?</hi> Surely there is ſomething in it, that we muſt have them ſo <hi>engrauen,</hi> that our <hi>min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> may poſeſſe them, our <hi>mouthes</hi> may publish them, at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroade,</hi> by <hi>day,</hi> and by <hi>night,</hi> at <hi>bed</hi> and <hi>borde,</hi> to our poſterity <hi>daily,</hi> to others <hi>occaſionally,</hi> can all this be for <hi>formall diſcourſe,</hi> or <hi>ſuperſiciall accquaintan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi> with the word of God? no ſure, there is more meant then this, come's to <hi>(which alone is nothing)</hi> the Lords minde is, that we should have <hi>ſpeciall familarity</hi> with his word, and be in <hi>continuall meditation,</hi> and practiſe therof, (ſignified by the binding of it on our hands and eyes) <hi>all theſe particulers</hi> that are named here, are to perſwade vs to <hi>that one principall</hi> truth, that we teach, to wit, that we muſt take home all the holy truth of God into our ſoules.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>law</hi> we may paſſe to the <hi>Prophets,</hi> but as we goe we will ſee what <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith to it, which if we doe, we shall heare of many heavenly ſayings to this purpoſe both in his <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and his booke called the <hi>Preacher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>former,</hi> we have <hi>many conſells</hi> to this practiſe with <hi>comforts</hi> belonging to them. As <hi>first,</hi> where he exhorteth men to <hi>[receiue Gods words, and to hide his commandements,
<note place="margin">Pro. 2.1. ver. 2.</note> to encline their eare, &amp; apply their harts to knowledg and vnderstanding.]</hi> And <hi>againe,</hi> that men
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20802:48"/>should <hi>[not forget the Law of God,
<note place="margin">cap. 3 1.</note> but let their harts keepe his commandements]</hi> and yet <hi>againe,</hi> that we ought to endeavour that <hi>[our harts doe retaine God words,]</hi>
               <note place="margin">cap. 4.4.</note> and that <hi>[we embrace them, and in noe wiſe,
<note place="margin">ver. 8.</note> let them goe]</hi> he is <hi>much</hi> vpon this matter, as vpon a thing of <hi>much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,</hi> and <hi>mighty importance,</hi> often adviſing all men hervnto. And in his <hi>latter booke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ, 12.11.</note> he tell's vs that <hi>[the words of the wiſe, should be vnto us as goades, and as nailes, faſtned vpon us, yea, into us]</hi> ſticking cloſe to vs, and keeping faſt within vs.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee <hi>Solomons</hi> minde, and know well what it is, and now let vs aske the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and they wil ſoone tell vs theirs, (for <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and all the <hi>men of God,</hi> are all in one <hi>tune</hi> for this truth) it hath beene evermore their manner to come to men with Gods meſſage, and to tell them their owne from him, not going <hi>behinde the dore,</hi> or ſpeaking <hi>behinde their backs,</hi> but perſonally, and to their <hi>heads,</hi> delivering the minde of God to the <hi>mightiest</hi> of them, as it were eaſy to inſtance in innumerable examples, not only of theſe <hi>more generall</hi> prophecies, that concerne <hi>peoples</hi> and <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> but in thoſe <hi>most ſpeciall</hi> which were <hi>indiuidually</hi> directed againſt <hi>Princes, Potentates,</hi> &amp; the <hi>great one's</hi> of the earth, as the king of <hi>Iudah, Iſraell, Babell, Egipt, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neveh,</hi> &amp;c. &amp; the like, every of which with many more, were ſpoken too, <hi>to their faces,</hi> in thoſe particulers wherin the Lord did intend they should know his minde.</p>
            <p>Soe we ſee we have the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> ſure to vs in this particuler, if now we shall alſo give eare to the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> it will alſo give abundant evidence hervnto both from <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf, &amp; alſo from his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in this point: <hi>Christ</hi> ſometimes ſpake <hi>plainely</hi> and ſpake
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20802:49"/>noe parable, as where he ſaith <hi>[Bleſſed are they that heare the word of God and keepe it]</hi> ſometimes (and more then once) in divers <hi>parables</hi> he is againe vpon it as in the parable of the <hi>ſeede,</hi> which muſt be layd deepe, and covered cloſe in the grounde, and not ſuperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>ſowed,</hi> for every foule to carry away: in the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> of the <hi>leauen,</hi> which muſt be raked vp into the midſt of the meale, and be <hi>mixed ſoe</hi> with it, that it may never be ſevered from it againe, but <hi>leaven</hi> every part of the lumpe. And for the <hi>apoſtles</hi> they are of the ſame minde with <hi>Chriſt</hi> their <hi>maſter,</hi> and ſpeake to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>Peter</hi> would haue vs <hi>[receive the word as new borne babes receiue milke]</hi> which is not only eaten &amp; ſwallowed,
<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.2.</note> but concocted and digeſted and becometh <hi>nutrimentall,</hi> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the ſubſtance of their bodies.
<note place="margin">col. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>Paul,</hi> would haue it <hi>dwell in us richly] that</hi> our harts might be a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,

            </p>
            <p>And now having all theſe witneſſes, what can we have <hi>more,</hi> or what neede we <hi>ſoe much,</hi> to confirme a truth ſo cleare? here (you ſee) is the <hi>vniver ſall</hi> aſſent, and concurrence of all Gods <hi>ſervants,</hi> yea, and of his <hi>ſonne</hi> too every one that ſpake by his ſpirits inſpratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſpake more or leſſe, to this truthes confirmation. But it would be needeleſſe to adde more teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Let vs come to conſider of ſuch <hi>reaſons,</hi> as may further leade vs into the light, and perſwſiaon herof; that we may ſee as well, <hi>why</hi> we muſt <hi>thus</hi> take home Gods truth, as only to know that ſoe we <hi>must</hi> doe. It
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20802:49"/>is a wiſe mans part, not only to know <hi>what</hi> he muſt doe, but alſo to vnderſtand <hi>why,</hi> that the <hi>reaſon</hi> of his duty may be diſcerned of him, as well as the <hi>jnjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we apply our ſelves to conſider, wherefore we muſt <hi>apply Gods truth</hi> in this manner, we shall ſoone perceive, that it is a thing conſorting with cleare, and apparant <hi>reaſon</hi> and that, in divers reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects ſome few wherof, we will lay downe before you.</p>

            <p>Againe as the ſcripture doth call vs <hi>heires,</hi> ſoe, doth it alſo account vs as the <hi>executors,

            <p>Were it not a <hi>ſilly</hi> and a <hi>shamefull</hi> thing for any to come in ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> court, (being ſummoned thither to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve his <hi>debt,</hi> or his <hi>legacy</hi>) and to refuſe to have any thing to doe with either, vpon this jdle allegation; ſaying, my <hi>name</hi> is not in this <hi>band,</hi> or in this <hi>will,</hi> I know not whether I may ſafely medle with this money or noe.

            <p>Now if in <hi>mans court</hi> this were a <hi>ridiculous plea</hi> and ſuch as was <hi>hardly</hi> ever <hi>heard off,</hi> how may we thinke God wil take it at our hands, when we thus weakely take part with <hi>Satan,</hi> againſt his glory and our owne good, &amp; caſt off our propriety in the things pertainig to both, vpon this <hi>ſimple,</hi> and <hi>ſinfull shift,</hi> which he ſugeſteth, whereby he cuningly mak'es vs <hi>rob</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>owne ſoules; God</hi> of the honor of his loue &amp; favour; <hi>our owne ſoules</hi> of the moſt worthy comforts and advantages, &amp; thoſe moſt gracious <hi>legacyes</hi> which are given and aſſigned to vs, by the <hi>last will and testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of the Lord Ieſus.</p>

            <p>And would not this inference be <hi>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strous,</hi> &amp; vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kably <hi>blaſphemous</hi> that we <hi>(that are Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> should deviſe argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts againſt Gods word, the jmmutability whereof is ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> avouched every where, <hi>that heauen &amp; earth must paſſe before one jot or title may fall therof:</hi> &amp; yet with one breath we will make it all voyde as a thing of naught, &amp; (by our argumentation) conclude that now it ſtandes for a <hi>cypher,</hi> rather them for any <hi>ſcripture.</hi>

            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:20802:62"/>
            <p>what neede the divell more advantage, he hath now enough to worke the vtter ſubverſion of all religion, ſeing <hi>(out of the mouthes of religions perſons)</hi> he can gather concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to proue the ſcripture (which is the ground of religion) not to be (as once it was) of any <hi>power authority, force,</hi> and <hi>vertue</hi> but rather like ſome <hi>ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If we <hi>shut not this out,</hi> all <hi>atheiſme wilbe let in,</hi> this is an open gap to all vngodlynes, for, if none haue right in the ſcriptures but they that are named, there is <hi>now no</hi> booke of God, <hi>no</hi> revealed will of his, <hi>no</hi> ſcripture, <hi>no</hi> rules of any religion <hi>extant:</hi> the life of all is tyed to the length of their dayes to whome it was ſpoken, and ſoe they being <hi>dead</hi> his truth is <hi>deceaſed</hi> with them and hath no more power to helpe vs then <hi>a dead man</hi> hath to helpe himſelf.

            <p>Nay, (which is yet more; and more hellish) by this <hi>reaſon</hi> of thoſe that in this particuler are thus <hi>vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable,</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:20802:62"/>the Lord muſt make as many <hi>Bibles</hi> as there be ages and generations of men, and put in all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of all men both good and bad too, if he make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be beleeved or obeyed. We muſt expect <hi>new editions</hi> of the ſcripture daily, wherin every one may read his owne part and know it to be his owne by his proper name annexed thervnto. Yea long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our dayes, even in all the ages of the olde and new teſtament, should many <hi>Bibles</hi> have beene <hi>extant,</hi> beſides that one, which concerned but a few <hi>Patriarcks Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> whereas the multitude of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers was very great beſides theſe, we may ſafely thinke the Lord had many people, beſide theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and extraordinary perſons, who were eſpecially ſpoken to.</p>
            <p>Now then, ſeing the Lord in his wiſdome never ſaw it meete to pen, and publish more then <hi>one Bible,</hi> &amp; that noe people of God, in any time or ſtate of the church did, or could ever challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g more, how groſſe &amp; egregiouſly ſinfull, &amp; ſenceleſſe are theſe, who vtter that, which if (in this perticuler of <hi>names</hi> wherof we now ſpeake) it might be <hi>juſtified,</hi> muſt <hi>condemne</hi> all Gods people of <hi>folly,</hi> and God himſelf of <hi>injury.</hi> God muſt be <hi>vnjust</hi> to witholde his will, they muſt be <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi> not to call for that which they might as well know, did concerne themſelves as <hi>Abraham, Dauid,</hi> or any other, whoſe name is ſoe often mentioned and recorded in this.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly:</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Eviden∣ce. </seg>4</label> this conceit of names concludes all the comfort of a Chriſtian to depend vpon his <hi>nameing</hi> wheras (intruth) that <hi>of it ſelf</hi> can evince no comfort at all: and therof we may be ſoone perſwaded, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>that,</hi> many are <hi>named,</hi> who are never <hi>comforted</hi> in Gods booke.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>that,</hi> the only comfort of a childe of God is to haue his <hi>name</hi> written in another booke to wit, <hi>that booke of life.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>For the <hi>firſt,</hi> he knowe's nothing as he ought to know, who knoweth not, that many are named in the <hi>bible</hi> for evill, not for good, nay it had beene good for them (in ſome ſort) that they had, had no names re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded there. As <hi>Cain, Saul, Ahitophell, Iudas,</hi> with many others who are ſo farre from being comforted by their <hi>names</hi> regiſtred, that they are shamed, bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; haue their <hi>names</hi> left for everlaſting reproach and infamy, that all ages and generations of men to the worlds end, might know what <hi>monstrous hypocrttes</hi> they were on <hi>earth,</hi> what <hi>miſerable reprobates</hi> they are in <hi>hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>ſecond,</hi> who knoweth not; that the true joy &amp; comfort of a chriſtian cannot conſiſt at all in being named in Gods booke, for even many of his holy ones are alſo markt <hi>with a black coale</hi> for ſome ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20802:63"/>wherby they are blemished to this day: but that which may joy them <hi>indeede,</hi> is the aſſurance of their names being written in the booke of life, many may have names in <hi>the Bible,</hi> who have none in <hi>that booke,</hi> but whoſoever hath his name written there, is ſure of all comforts that are revealed and promiſed here. Hence it was that our ſauiour gave that <hi>Item</hi> to his diſciples who returning from the excecution of their commiſſion, were almoſt <hi>ouerjoyed</hi> with the happy ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe they founde, and came to Chriſt with moſt glad harts, <hi>[Master,
<note place="margin">Luk 10 9.</note> even the divells are ſubdued to us]</hi> well ſayes he, that is ſome matter to joy in, you may be glad of that, but if you would joy in that which <hi>is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede</hi> a ſound cauſe of rejoycing, as being ſuch wherin none but Gods elect have any part,
<note place="margin">ver. 20.</note> [<hi>Rejoyce</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this, that your names are written in the booke of life</hi>] in the <hi>other,</hi> reprobates may rejoyce as well as you, but <hi>in this</hi> they have no portion, it is your only, and your all-ſufficient cauſe of rejoycing. And the conſolation of being written in this celeſtiall regiſter, is both <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> only to true chriſtians, and <hi>common</hi> to all; none but the faithfull can have it, and none of the faithfull but have it.</p>
            <p>So ſaith the ſpirit, <hi>[they that overcome,
<note place="margin">Ren. 3.5.</note> their names are written, and shall not be blotted out of the lambes booke of life,]</hi>
               <note place="margin">cap. 20.15.</note> and <hi>[every one wohſe name was not founde written in the booke of life, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone]</hi> but <hi>[they whoſe names were found there, might enter into that holy,
<note place="margin">cap. 21.27.</note> and most glorious ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then we ſee plainly, by theſe particulers, that <hi>theſe two</hi> things will follow, to wit, 1. that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may have his name writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the <hi>Bible,</hi> &amp; yet not in <hi>heauen,</hi> as many
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20802:64"/>hypocrits and <hi>reprobates</hi> haue; and. 2. that a man may not haue his name here, yet written in heaven as mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the <hi>elect</hi> haue. And if theſe <hi>two propoſitions</hi> be true and vnreproueable (as we ſee they are) what vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity can be founde in theſe <hi>fonde</hi> conceites of ours? what conſequence of comfort or diſcomfort is is to any man whether he be <hi>named</hi> in this booke of God <hi>or noe?</hi> Let vs ſurceaſe to mention this which cannot <hi>profſit vs,</hi> and make ſure of the other, which is ſuch <hi>a ſure evidence</hi> of our ſalvation. And this is our <hi>fourth</hi> evidence againſt this pretence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fiftly,</hi>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Eviden∣ce. </seg>5</label> this allegation of names is <hi>popish,</hi> &amp; doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the <hi>papists</hi> in their error of denying the <hi>cear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety</hi> of the ſalvation of the elect; and when they argue againſt the truth of God herin, they vrge this very thing; where (ſay they) is it written that I ſuch a one, or ſuch a one <hi>by name John, Thomas, Mary, Martha,</hi> or any man or woman, shalbe ſaved. This is their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage <hi>vp and downe,</hi> and shall the people of God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke it? shal <hi>Satan</hi> make chriſtians to ſpeake as anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt doth? <hi>God for bid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were a moſt eaſy matter to make <hi>them</hi> a full an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer &amp; quitt them with like queſtions in other caſes: where is it written that any man <hi>by name</hi> hall riſe at the laſt day; is it not therefore ſure that they shall, becauſe they are not named? by this reaſon all <hi>papists</hi> muſt be notorious heretikes as ſome of their <hi>holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> have beene, who have shewed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves damned hell hounds in denying as evident truth as this. Againe I would fayne know of any <hi>papists</hi> whether no more shalbe beleeved of any man then that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of him by name; if not, then no man hath any thing at all to beleeve now, becauſe no man that now lives
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20802:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath his name in the ſcripture; if yea, then why may not this truth of the aſſurance of ſalvation be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the faithfull, as well as any other wherin they are no more named then in this?</p>
            <p>But our purpoſe is not to refute <hi>them</hi> now, but to reprove <hi>you,</hi> who confirme and harden them in this their falshood &amp; hereſy by the like allegations of the ſame things for your ſelves. The divell is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubtile to ſeduce you both, to witholde the truth of God in vnrighteouſnes, and to turne it into a lye, by ſuggeſting this pretence of names into your myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and mouthes.

            <p>Thus Satan make's <hi>you ignorant papists</hi> vnawares, and make's <hi>them jmpudent papists</hi> through your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance herin. And shall we ſupport that (popery) which we hate? And this is our fifth Evidence againſt this pretence.</p>
            <p>The ſixt and laſt is,
<label type="milestone">

            <p>Well, be it graunted, we will moſt willingly yeelde it, that you are not (nor cannot be in your ſelf) <hi>worthy,</hi> nothing is more true, it were extreame <hi>pride,</hi> and vnſpeakeable <hi>preſumption</hi> for any man to conceit, there were any worth in him at all, by which he might merit, or make clayme to the leaſt comfort he can receive.

            </p>
            <p>To begin then,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Eviden∣ce. </seg>1</label> our <hi>firſt evidence</hi> againſt this <hi>ſecond pretence</hi> is, the <hi>contradiction</hi> it hath with the other, for if there be <hi>any</hi> ſtrength in <hi>this,</hi> there is <hi>none</hi> in that which went before, and if <hi>that</hi> be <hi>ſounde, this</hi> is <hi>ſight.</hi> For why? what auaileth it for one to haue his <hi>name</hi> in Gods booke, and himſelf to be directly ſpoken too, if he be not <hi>worthy</hi> of any thing promiſed to him; and if a man be <hi>worthy,</hi> then (by this reaſoning) his <hi>nameing,</hi> or <hi>not nameing,</hi> is a matter of nothing. Thus theſe two <hi>Satanticall conceits</hi> doe cut one anothers <hi>throates,</hi> any man may jmagine they are not of God, I ceauſe they agree not with one another, it is for the <hi>father of lyes</hi> thus to confute, yea confounde himſelf in that which he ſuggeſteth. The God of truth never ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke's any thing which will not well <hi>conſert</hi> with it ſelf, there is a heavenly <hi>harmony</hi> in all that the God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſaye's: But the divell (being himſelf a deſtroyer) ſuborne's that wich will both deſtroy it ſelf, and vs, &amp; yet we are ſoe <hi>vnwiſe</hi> as not to know it.</p>
            <p>But let vs note it more narrowly now, &amp; take good notice of in this pretence compared with the former.</p>
            <p>That which was vrged <hi>before</hi> did (as we haue she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed) nullify Gods truth to all except ſuch as were <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> this which is pretended <hi>now,</hi> doth make their title
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20802:66"/>voyd too; before you thought <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> &amp;c. happy men, for being <hi>named</hi> they might apply the promiſes; now vnleſſe they were <hi>worthy</hi> their <hi>nameing</hi> doth not helpe; ſoe that, what the <hi>first</hi> pretence did leaue <hi>but to few,</hi> this <hi>ſecond</hi> doth take from <hi>all,</hi> and now no <hi>Patriarch, Prophet,</hi> or <hi>Apostle,</hi> is in better caſe <hi>(by this allegation)</hi> then one of vs; for vnleſſe they have <hi>worth</hi> in them, they can have <hi>no warrant</hi> to apply the comforts of God ſoe that now (even theſe holy men) are as ſarre to ſeeke of their conſolation <hi>(for want of worthines)</hi> as wee weere for want of names.</p>
            <p>That the beſt of them was not <hi>worthy,</hi> I thinke you beleeve, &amp; it is evident they were not, by their owne acknowledgment, they that have had <hi>most grace</hi> from God have beene <hi>most abaſed</hi> in their owne eyes, and have ever diſclaymed with all deadly deteſtation and <hi>defiance,</hi> the entertaynement of any ſuch proud conceits.</p>
            <p>The man we have ſoe often named, and of whome our text doth intreat, even <hi>Iacob</hi> who here doth (as you ſee) ſoe comfortably entitle himſelf vnto theſe promiſes of God, and ſo powerfully apply them; he in the next verſe to our text renounceth <hi>all worthines</hi> and freely confeſſeth, he is leſſe <hi>(in worthynes)</hi> then the leaſt of all Gods mercyes, not worthy of <hi>any one,</hi> noe not of <hi>the least</hi> of any of them; and ſurely all the ſervants of <hi>Jacobs God</hi> are of the ſame minde. Yet you ſee, he (&amp; many more whome we have notifyed) did take home the truth of God with warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enough from God though they founde no worthines therof in themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now then, ſeing (you ſee) whervnto this come's that what is pleaded <hi>in this,</hi> doth devoure and make
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20802:67"/>
               <hi>voyde</hi> what was vrged in <hi>the other,</hi> and that <hi>theſe two</hi> cannot by any meanes <hi>agree</hi> with one another, you haue good reaſon to <hi>agree</hi> to neither, but notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding we haue <hi>neither names in Gods booke, nor worthynes in our ſelves,</hi> let vs apply the promiſes of Gods loue &amp; ſavour to our ſoules; for they doe not depend vpon any <hi>ſuch things</hi> as theſe: Noe childe of God ever had any <hi>worthynes,</hi> yet every one hath had the intereſt and benefit of his bleſſed promiſes.

            </p>
            <p>Hence it is that the Lord ſendes the <hi>Iewes</hi> word that <hi>[his thoughts are not as their thoughts]</hi> as if he should ſay, it matters not what <hi>you thinke;</hi> what <hi>I thinke,</hi> is the thing you muſt depend vpon:

            <p>What then, though you thinke your ſelfe vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy? if the Lord thinke you worthy it is well enough, <hi>you</hi> are <hi>bounde</hi> to the one, <hi>he</hi> is <hi>free</hi> to the other, though it be <hi>your duty</hi> to account meanely of your ſelf, yet it is <hi>his mercy</hi> to accept you as worthy of his beſt favours, and your eſtate muſt be conceived of, according to <hi>his,</hi> not <hi>your</hi> owne eſtimate.

            <p>And were any of them, or any other, ſoe <hi>ſimple in this</hi> (as you are <hi>ſinfull in the other</hi>) to caſt off, refuſe, and reject all, becauſe they were <hi>not worthy</hi> of that which was given, and to <hi>deny the receit</hi> becauſe they <hi>had no deſert?</hi> ſure I thinke no age can yeeld an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any ſuch egregious folly: that any one of theſe was ever heard to ſay, I am <hi>not worthy</hi> of this le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy, therefore I <hi>dare</hi> have nothing to doe with it.</p>
            <p>And shall we (as by this our allegation we doe) make our God <hi>leſſe loving, leſſe liberall</hi> then man? shall they give to <hi>infants,</hi> who could deſerue nothing, to <hi>poore men,</hi> who have deſerved nothing, to <hi>vile perſons</hi> who haue deſerved no ſuch thing? and shall the Lords hand be shorter then ours?

The jujury and dishonour of God is not a litle herin, the Lord will looke you should <hi>doe him right</hi> (as you haue thus hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly <hi>wronged him</hi>) by <hi>repentance</hi> for what is paſt, and <hi>reformation</hi> hearafter, that now you leave vrging your owne <hi>vnworthynes</hi> (to any ſuch end as this) and never

            <p>What should I ſay more? yet who can ſay enough of this particuler? ſeing the Lord himſelf hath ſayd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re then all the world can vtter touching this matter, to the end that his ſaints might have abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s meaſured vnto them, filled vp to the brym, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed downe &amp; runing over;

            <p>All the precious words of God are yours to apply; his ſure mercies are yours to receive, they were once vttered by God himſelf and by his holy ſecretaryes recorded for ever, for their ſakes which shalbe heires of ſalvation.

            <p>It is <hi>hard to ſay</hi> whether any thing can be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to vs <hi>as a favour</hi> which we receive <hi>not in faith,</hi> and whervpon faith never faſtened.</p>

            <p>And if thus they doe, as it is their duty, (and their <hi>not doing</hi> of it, wil draw downe heavy vengeance vpon them) then, will their miſery and feare, flow <hi>apace</hi> vpon them, even <hi>ſo faſt,</hi> that they shall not be able, either to eſcape the <hi>ſwiftnes</hi> of it, but it will come to them; nor, to withſtand the <hi>rage</hi> and violence therof but it will ſeize them, in ſpight of all their curſed <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity</hi> and <hi>preſumption,</hi> whereby they often put their evill farre from them.

            <p>Goe ye ſinners and vngodly perſons of all ſorts, reade over &amp; pervſe, every <hi>part,</hi> every <hi>page</hi> of Gods ſacred booke, and in what <hi>leafe</hi> or line ſoever ye mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te with any thing that favours of <hi>confuſion,</hi> or ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de's like a curſe, or ſentence of <hi>comdemnation,</hi> ſay to your ſelues, as our <hi>Jacob</hi> doth here, <hi>[Thou Lord ſaiſt this to me]</hi> this part of Gods truth is my portion, and belongeth to me, my jmpiety applei's this to me, my

            <p>Never once dreame of <hi>thrusting off</hi> theſe things from your ſelves, you cannot shift off that which the

            <p>He that will heare <hi>his owne,</hi> may ſoe be wrought vpon, as that he shall not <hi>beare</hi> it, it may worke vpon him <hi>that repentance</hi> to ſalvation which is never to be repented off.

            <p>It hath too palpably appeared to be the manner of the <hi>most wicked men</hi> (and I know not whether any thing may be a more <hi>manifest eare-marke</hi> of an jm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and vngodly perſon) to be extreamely jmpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient when the truth of God hath beene <hi>plainely</hi> tolde them; theſe are of the number of thoſe <hi>wretches</hi> which were foretolde by the <hi>Apostle,</hi> that <hi>[endure not whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome doctrine,]</hi> that which ſoundes not <hi>ſweetely,</hi> and is not <hi>melodious,</hi> is no <hi>meate</hi> or <hi>muſike</hi> for them, they are ſo farre from <hi>application,</hi> that they will not give God <hi>audience,</hi> but either <hi>wilfully withdraw</hi> themſelves from the houſe of God where it is ſpoken, or <hi>being

               <item>2. <hi>how heavy</hi> the hand of God wilbe in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame &amp; <hi>extraordinary punishment</hi> of him that doth ſoe.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The <hi>act</hi> is exceedingly amplified, and aggravated, if we doe well conſider the particulers of the text, wherin we finde it <hi>branched</hi> and <hi>blazed out,</hi> to be <hi>an evill</hi> conſiſting of <hi>many evills,</hi> a very <hi>compoſition</hi> of <hi>many</hi> impietyes, and <hi>much</hi> corruption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> it is an impious thwarting of God, a croſſing of him; even a giving him, <hi>the lye</hi> to his face, when any man shall <hi>dare</hi> to ſay <hi>[I shall have peace though &amp;c.]</hi> Is not this extreame <hi>impudency,</hi> thus to <hi>out face</hi> the Lord of heaven in his owne truth? to tell him (as it were) <hi>to his teeth,</hi> that we shall have peace, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely

            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is a proude exalting of our ſelves aboue the Lord &amp; a truſting vpon our owne <hi>vayne lying</hi> and <hi>blaſphemous</hi> words <hi>[bleſsing our ſelves]</hi> and giving no creddit to his moſt ſtable and immutable words of truth; as if our bleſſing of our ſelves, had farre more efficacy to ſave and comfort vs, then his words of <hi>curſing</hi> have to caſt vs downe, and terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy vs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is an <hi>encreaſing</hi> of ſin, we <hi>adde</hi> one evill to another, and ſoe <hi>lade</hi> our ſoules with more and more impiety, <hi>augmenting</hi> our evill before the Lord, and encouraging our ſelves in the ſame, by this <hi>bleſsing of our ſelues</hi> in our ſinfull courſes, and caſting aſide Gods righteous and heavy <hi>curſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe <hi>three</hi> amplifications of this impious and hellish <hi>act,</hi> are apparant in the text and thus much ſin doth <hi>he</hi> commit, that <hi>applyeth not,</hi> but <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth off</hi> the ſacred word, and truth of God from himſelf.</p>
            <p>The punishmet due to this <hi>threefolde act</hi> of impiety, followe's in the text too, &amp; it is layd out both <hi>negatiue</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Loe, <hi>thus</hi> shall it be done to the man that the Lord will ave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge himſelf vpon, for this one ſin of <hi>shifting off</hi> the ſacred truth of God from himſelf.

This

            <p>Let vs then <hi>(deare christians)</hi> take heede, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of a ſtubborne hart, a ſtiffe necke, an jmpious ſpirit, to <hi>throw away</hi> what the Lord ſaith to vs, Doe not provoke him to jealouſy, we are not able to dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le with him, he is ſtronger then we; know we that nothing well more <hi>vexe,</hi> or ſooner <hi>prouoke</hi> him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, then this jmpiety, of refuſing to apply his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to our ſelves.

            <p>For why? conſider I pray you, <hi>what good</hi> can be <hi>in him, what evill</hi> can be <hi>out</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> who rejecteth what God ſaith? it is not poſſible he should haue <hi>any good,</hi> who will none of that word, which is the <hi>only ground</hi> of all good to vs, and the <hi>only guide</hi> of vs vnto it: neither is <hi>any euill jmpoſsible,</hi> but all moſt eaſy to be faſtened vpon the man, who forſaketh the ſole and <hi>ſoueraigne</hi> meanes of <hi>his good.</hi> That man muſt needes heare <hi>Satan,</hi> that heareth not God, and if once the divell be maſter of <hi>our eare,</hi> and haue it at command, what can be ſoe <hi>corrupt</hi> or <hi>accurſed,</hi> which he will not convay into vs?</p>
            <p>How much better, and more happy were it for vs, to hearken to the <hi>heauenly voyce</hi> of God, though that he ſaith, should ſeeme <hi>heauy</hi> to vs. The <hi>worst</hi> he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth is to make vs <hi>good,</hi> and to further our <hi>best estate.</hi> He doth <hi>wish us well</hi> in the moſt <hi>wofull</hi> ſentences he vtters againſt vs. Let him that hath an eare to heare, heare what the Lord ſaith, which if we will doe, we

            <p>Now <hi>their hart</hi> is shut againſt <hi>his hand,</hi> then shall <hi>his hand</hi> be shut vp againſt <hi>their harts.</hi> No <hi>counſell, command, precept,</hi> or <hi>perſwaſion</hi> of God, would prevaile with them to receive them; and it is come to paſſe, that no <hi>prayer, cry,</hi> or <hi>ſupplication,</hi> will prevaile with God to give them.

It were eaſy to abound in naming perſons of both ſorts, but we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with a few. Curſed <hi>Cain,</hi> (the firſt caſtaway of all mankinde, the <hi>prime reprobate</hi> of the world,) the Lord ſpake much to him touching his ſin and punishment; did he refuſe to apply any of thoſe perticulers which were ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to him, either <hi>before</hi> his ſin comitted or <hi>after?</hi> did he not give God the hearing
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20802:88"/>of all that he ſayd, (though it is too true that much of it never did him any good), nay did he not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d all thoſe fearfull comminations of himſelf which the Lord breathed out againſt his barbarous fact? and ſoe take them as intended to himſelf, as that his hart was wounded with them, and he cryed out <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately</hi> becauſe of the doome which was paſſed vpon him? The whole current of the ſtory shewe's he acknowledged all to be <hi>his,</hi> that was ſayd to him, yea even that which was <hi>harshest,</hi> and hardeſt of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. Wretched and reiected <hi>Saul,</hi> did not he ſoe too, when Samuel told him <hi>his owne</hi> from God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his ſtate temporall and eternal, and gaue him to vnderſtand that God had caſt him away from his owne kingdome on <hi>earth,</hi> and from the kingdome of <hi>heaven</hi> too; doth it appeare that he caſt off any thing ſpoken by Gods prophet to this purpoſe? nay the contrary is cleare, that he did conceiue God meant all to him and ſoe he tooke it as the ſequell shewe's.

            <p>How many more of this rout, might I recko<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp who with Foelix have trembled at ſome divine doctrines, and have not attayned ſuch a ſtraine of ſin as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take

Shall a <hi>Cain</hi> quake and carry himſelf as a man ſoe deeply affected with the word of God? and shall an <hi>Ahab,</hi> and a <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſuch others (as are ſealed vp to eternall shame and contempt) doe the ſame? And shall <hi>Saints</hi> be behinde theſe <hi>Sinners,</hi> and refuſe to apply their part of the Lords truth, when ſuch infernall vaſſalls have done it? shall the divell bring theſe before the Lord to <hi>vpbrayd him to his face,</hi> that he ha's ſome <hi>reprobates</hi> who will doe more in this point of duty, then ſome that goe for his children, and are accounted holy and <hi>religions?</hi> and that he can prevaile with ſome of his lym's to give creddit to Gods divine truth even <hi>for their evill,</hi> when many of his owne holy ones, doe refuſe to entertaine the truth therof ſome <hi>for their good?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh, what shall our God <hi>looſe,</hi> and what shall Satan <hi>gaine,</hi> when it shall come herevnto, that the divell shall plead this advantage too truly? what may we expect who put weapons into his hands to <hi>fight against the Lord,</hi> whoſe honor (herin) he will not ſpare to his vtmoſt, to endamage &amp; abuſe, that he may enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce him (in juſt reveng of this inſufferable indignity done thervnto) to <hi>fight against vs,</hi> with the sharpeſt engine's of his juſtice.</p>

            <p>Neither did this begin to be a truth now at this ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, as if it had never beene ſoe before, but it was thus from the beginning, and began to be <hi>experimentally</hi> true, as the <hi>first man</hi> that ever God made &amp; gave a law vnto for doing his will, can well and ſoundly certify vs, that <hi>well doing,</hi> &amp; <hi>well-being</hi> went ever togeather.</p>

            <p>Nay, that we may yet ſee the vnmoveable goodnes of God, that he is ſtill of the <hi>ſame minde,</hi> though we are not the <hi>ſame men,</hi> &amp; though we fayle in our <hi>obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> he faile's not in his <hi>kindnes.</hi> Beholde he is <hi>God, &amp; changeth not,</hi> immutable in favour, conſtant in his compaſſions, a <hi>ſure freinde</hi> to a faithfull man, <hi>a well-willer</hi> to <hi>a well-doer,</hi> ſtill and ever: that howſoever we have offended againſt him provoked &amp; greived him, &amp; enforced him to deprive vs of our happy eſtate; <hi>yet,</hi> hath he rayſed vs againe, &amp; brought vs into ſuch a bleſſed condition, as wherin, yet we may be made moſt happy parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the truth of this inſtruction.</p>

Thus wee ſee that <hi>every way</hi> wee are ſatisfyed in this branch of the <hi>obiection:</hi> And it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters nothing <hi>now,</hi> what conſtruction men make of any thing done (by men) to the Saints of God, the queſtion is only of that which God himſelf doth, and of that <hi>good</hi> which he <hi>produceth</hi> out of that evill which men doe vnto vs, and let vs looke well vpon <hi>either,</hi> or <hi>both</hi> of theſe, and wee shall finde our <hi>text</hi> and the doctrine therof moſt true.</p>
            <p>Now touching the other branch of wicked mens proſperity, it is a thing to be much pittied not to be at all envyed, and that wee may not either <hi>jdlely,</hi> or <hi>ignorantly</hi> wonder at it, let vs wiſely conſider theſe enſuing particulers.</p>

            <p>Note well, they are not curſed, in the <hi>want</hi> of theſe things, (every body would thinke it a curſe to be deprived of them, and to have, no children, cattell, friut, or encreaſe) but they <hi>haue them,</hi> yet are accurſed in them, and <hi>with them,</hi> even while they doe enjoy them: as <hi>Malachie</hi> once tolde the wicked preiſts that God would <hi>[curſe their bleſsings]</hi> nay, that he had done it already: that albeit they had <hi>bleſsings,</hi> yet <hi>as bleſsings</hi> they had them not, but in the nature and ſtate of <hi>curſes.</hi> And is it not a moſt hydeous and heavy judgment, that a man should have bleſſings and be without the <hi>bleſſednes</hi> of them, and not only ſoe, but to be baned, poyſoned, and vtterly overthrowne by them?

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whatſoever happines doth befall wicked perſons here; it is only to <hi>harden their ſinfull harts,</hi> and to multiply their ſins againſt the Lorde.

            <p>For thus they (by the divells aſiſtance) doe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and argue within themſelves. <hi>God doth thus and thus bleſſe me, with ſuch and ſuch abundance; I haue ſoe much, &amp; ſoe much of this and of that; why shoulde I not think my estate ſuch as he is pleaſed withall? and ſoe good as content's him: I heare theſe hott preachers take on against ſuch and ſuch ſins, I cannot tell, but I ſee

And wherefore should I not beleeue that God think's well of vs, when he deale's ſo well with vs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus,</hi> on goe they (by occaſion of the <hi>good</hi> things they have) to be <hi>well</hi> conceited of their <hi>evill</hi> ſtate, and ſoe gather concluſions to continue in the ſame, &amp; that muſt needes adde to the number, and meaſure of their ſins, and make the weight of them abſolutely <hi>in ſupportable,</hi> and the vengance of God, due vnto them infinitely <hi>inſufferable.</hi> This is all (when it is wel ſumm'd vp) that a wicked mans bleſſings come to, to <hi>harden</hi> his harte, to <hi>heape</hi> to his ſin, to <hi>helpe</hi> on Gods ſpeedy <hi>indignation,</hi> and his owne ſwift <hi>damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have proved the <hi>truth</hi> of the point, and freed it from <hi>falshood;</hi> and it being fully confirmed, &amp; cleared, we are now to paſſe vnto the <hi>vſes</hi> of the ſame which are ſuch as concerne <hi>all ſorts</hi> of perſons, good and bad, holy and prophane joyntely and ſeverally.</p>

            <p>It were <hi>eaſy</hi> for me (if it were <hi>expedient</hi> for you) to inſtance ſome few perticulers, which as the <hi>first fruits</hi> of my labours, I ſaw reformed among you, but I ſpare to <hi>nominate</hi> any, but ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſpare to <hi>notify</hi> thus much, that all men may ſee, what <hi>glory</hi> to himſelf, &amp; what <hi>good</hi> to your <hi>ſelves,</hi> &amp; <hi>me,</hi> the Lord meant vs in his mercy.</p>
            <p>This <hi>beginning</hi> of good, made my <hi>ſervice,</hi> my <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> &amp; this place began to be like a <hi>litle heaven</hi> to me; yea (to ſpeake the truth from my hart, as before the Lord) I much doubt whether, <hi>(out of heauen)</hi> I shall
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20802:108"/>ever be ſoe happy againe, as I did apprehend my ſelf to be, when you <hi>(like the Apostles hearers)</hi> began thus, to <hi>crowne</hi> my labours, with the <hi>timely earnest,</hi> of ſuch an amendement; my <hi>hope</hi> was I shoulde have beene <hi>lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> happy with you, but it fayleth me; howbeit my ſoules vnceſſant deſire is and shalbe, that the hope of your <hi>happines,</hi> may never faile you, in any that shall come after me.</p>
            <p>Thus were we both entred into a <hi>bleſſed race,</hi> to the end wherof, I know the Lord can bring vs, though we may not goe both <hi>together,</hi> as my ſoule deſired, yet (if we faile not <hi>to meete</hi> the Lord) we cannot (by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce) but <hi>meete</hi> together, in the glory of that kingdome, which he hath promiſed, to all that <hi>perſevere</hi> in vpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtnes before him.</p>
            <p>The God of heaven knoweth, that I did <hi>ſo prize</hi> your worthy ſociety (in theſe <hi>ſpirituall</hi> reſpects) that I could have abundantly joyed to have beene <hi>[your ſervant for Ieſus ſake,]</hi> all my dayes; I did preferre it to all other, as moſt deare and precious to me <hi>vnder heaven.</hi> Had I not reaſon, when I ſee the Lord himſelf, aſſimulating vs to each other, vnder thoſe <hi>repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> wherin the partyes are in deareſt relation to one another: as of <hi>father</hi> and <hi>childe, mother</hi> &amp; <hi>infant?</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce we are ſometimes ſayd to <hi>beget</hi> men to God, and ſometimes, to <hi>trauell</hi> in our <hi>birth,</hi> till Chriſt be formed in our people.</p>
            <p>Who can be inſenſible of the <hi>ſeparation</hi> of theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene whome, the <hi>conjunction</hi> is ſoe neere? ſurely none but <hi>he</hi> alone, can ſupport me againſt the <hi>ſorrow</hi> therof, who hath promiſed to <hi>gather</hi> all his owne, in ſuch an inconceivable kinde of <hi>conjunction</hi> as shall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke vs everlaſtingly <hi>one,</hi> both with <hi>one another,</hi> and with

               <hi>himſelf,</hi> and our <hi>ſaviour,</hi> where he wilbe our <hi>father</hi> and our <hi>king,</hi> &amp; we (through his Chriſt) shalbe his <hi>children,</hi> and <hi>kings</hi> too, to raigne with him to all <hi>eternity,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, have I beene with yow, in my <hi>poore duties:</hi> but in all that I haue ſayd, you (and all men) muſt ever <hi>except my infirmityes,</hi> which are not few, and my mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde frailtyes; which (as I am ſinfull flesh and blood), could not be wholy hid, or <hi>vn-obſerued.</hi> We are <hi>men,</hi> (ſayd <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when the ſottish people would have worshipped them as <hi>Gods) ſubject to the ſame paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that you are.

            <p>Be not offended then at <hi>vs,</hi> or at <hi>religion</hi> for our ſakes, becauſe you ſee our <hi>evill,</hi> with our <hi>good;</hi> be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled (rather) in your ſelves, &amp; feare your one greater <hi>danger,</hi> and thinke with your ſelves; if theſe men who draw ſoe neere vnto God, who ſpend their liues (as it were) in heaven, whoſe liues are, (or ought to be) nothing but a continuall conference, and familiarity with the Lord, cannot yet be free of frailty, &amp; offence; ſure I may doubt my eſtate, leaſt that which <hi>appeareth</hi> in them, will <hi>vſurpe</hi> over my, if they <hi>feele</hi> ſoe much, I may feare, leaſt it will <hi>overflow,</hi> and <hi>ſincke</hi> me. Thus
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20802:109"/>meditating, you shalbe kept, from being at all <hi>offended</hi> at vs, &amp; the more from <hi>offending</hi> God your ſelves: you wilbe the more <hi>compaſſionate</hi> over vs, the more <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect</hi> over your <hi>owne</hi> wayes, &amp; ſoe the Lord shall have honour in vs <hi>both,</hi> &amp; you will learne to doe to <hi>vs,</hi> as he doth to all <hi>his, [accept vs according to that which we haue, not according to that we haue not]</hi> not deſpiſing our <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrey,</hi> becauſe of our <hi>infirmity,</hi> but rather, ſeing the Lord doth entruſt vs over you, you should yeelde your ſelves vnto vs, as to <hi>Gods guides.</hi> I beſeech you againe, that you will neither be <hi>offended</hi> at our fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, nor draw them into <hi>example,</hi> to cauſe you to <hi>offend,</hi> we never deſire further <hi>jmitation</hi> from <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> then we take from <hi>Chriſt.</hi> It is the greife, and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateſt wound of our ſoules, that we can be no more <hi>like</hi> our Lord, &amp; maſter, who hath entruſted vs, nor more <hi>ſitt</hi> for the performance of his pleaſure: O let no man be the <hi>worſe,</hi> for our <hi>weaknes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Al the joy we have is herin, that (notwithſtanding our evill) the Lord hath judged vs faithfull, and put vs into his ſervice, and given vs the <hi>ſeale</hi> of our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrey, in cauſing his worke to proſper in our hand.

            <p>Thus now in al reſpects, I <hi>haue beene with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how <hi>you haue beene with me,</hi> I wish I had ability to declare according to myne owne <hi>deſire,</hi> and your

            <p>Know, I pray you, that all theſe favours are <hi>engraven,</hi> vpon a moſt <hi>gratefull</hi> hart; and that, as the Lord will not be <hi>vnrighteous</hi> to forget your labour of love to recompence it: ſo neither can I be ſoe <hi>barbarouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livious,</hi> as not to remember both <hi>you,</hi> &amp; <hi>them,</hi> to the <hi>Lord,</hi> yea and vnto <hi>men,</hi> that they may ſee your good workes, and glorify him, who hath given you harts to doe good, and to diſtribute ſoe abundantly.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſay of you in the time paſt, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſayd in my text for the <hi>future,</hi> and I cannot but acknowledge and avow, that you have performed that to me, which was promiſed to him: you have <hi>dealt well with me</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way.
